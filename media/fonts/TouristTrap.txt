Tourist Trap is my effort at the type of lettering used on those
great t-shirts that Grandma buys the little tykes in Fort Walton
Beach or Gatlinburg. Both the outline and the "fill" are included
in the same font. And with the iron-on transfer paper now available
for you home ink jet printer, you can now make the shirts at home
without spending the money or the hours behind the wheel to actually
take the kids on vacation.

Oh, yeah....I almost forgot. If (for some unknown reason) you really
do want to make a donation to encourage me to continue my creative
efforts, send it to the address above. (Yeah....As If!) Thanks & Enjoy!
